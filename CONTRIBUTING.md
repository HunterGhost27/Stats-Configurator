# Contributing to Stats Configurator

Although I've tried my best to make this project as feature-complete as possible, there probably is a lot of room for improvement. Infact this is the first time I've attemped something of this scope, and I'm a hobbyist coder. I welcome and appreciate any kind of contribution, including but not limited to:

- Improved code
- Documentation changes (Sure could use those)
- Suggestions and feedback
- Ideas for features or improvements
- Bug-reports and technical issues
- Example configurations for others
- More collections
- Reference documents for others
