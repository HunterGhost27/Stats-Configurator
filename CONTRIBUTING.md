# Contributing to Stats Configurator

Although I've tried my best to make this project as feature-complete as possible, there probably is a lot of room for improvement. Infact this is the first time I've attemped something of this scope, and I'm only a hobbyist coder. I welcome and appreciate any kind of contribution, including but not limited to:

- Improvements in the code-base. I had little-to-no-idea of what I was doing half the time, you can demystify the spaghetti code into something more lucid and precise.  
- Documentation changes (Sure could use those). Documentation is harder than programming, change my mind.
- Ideas for features or improvements.
- Bug-reports and technical issues.
- Example configurations for others.
- More collection presets.
- Reference documents for others.
- Suggestions and feedback on any aspect of the mod.

I thank-you in advance.
