# Contributing to Stats Configurator

Although I've tried to make this project as thoroughly feature-complete as possible, I still am just one man. Infact this is the first time I've attemped something of this scope. As such, there is always room for improvement. I welcome and appreciate any contribution, including but not limited to:

- Suggestions and Feedback
- Ideas for features or improvements
- Bug-reports and technical issues
- Documentation changes (Sure could use those)
- Example configurations for others
