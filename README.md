# **Stats Configurator**

## Divinity Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition

----------

The **Stats Configurator** allows you to modify and customize stats. It's a tool for users to make changes to stat-entries by creating config files. It also allows other mods to interface with its functionality to achieve the same. Through configuration files, you can change attributes like action-points cost, cooldown, gold-value, display-name, damage-values and resistances, memory cost and many more.

## Mod at a Glance

* **Edit stats dynamically.** _Modify_, _customize_ and _rebalance_ the game as you see fit.
* _Edit_ a group of stats at the same time with **collections**. Use the **presets** or **create your own**.
* _Share_ your **config-data** with your **peers**. So everyone's on the same page.
* _Save_ your stat-overrides **persistently** in the save-file, or change them up each session.
* _Export_ a list of every single stat-entry for reference.
* _Use_ the _Inspect Skill_ to print stat-entries relevent to a target.
* Comprehensive _in-game_ diagnostics, changelogs and instructions.
* Can _interface_ with **other mods** and provide them the same power. Create **MCMs** for your mods!
* Dependency-free integration allows **quick setup** of mod-config-menus for your mod with some basic functionality.
* For more _advanced control_, the mod's functionality is available through **Lua**.
* Hate fiddling with _menus_ and _UI_. Use **console commands!** - Add or Remove Skills, Search for stats, and more.
* The mod is **highly configurable**. :)
