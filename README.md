# **Stats Configurator** for Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

----------

The **Stats Configurator** allows you to modify and customize stats. It's a tool for users to make changes to stat-entries based on user-created config files. It also allows other mods to interface with its functionality to achieve the same. Through configuration files, you can change attributes like action-points cost, cooldown, gold-value, display-name, damage-values and resistances, memory cost and many more.
